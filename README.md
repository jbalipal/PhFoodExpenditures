# Food Expenditure in the Philippines

I have examined the data gathered from the [Family Income and Expenditure Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure) based on certain assumptions in order to determine features that have a strong effect on what kind of foods family's spend their income on. 

Clone PhFoodExpenditures and run the Rmd files in the scripts directory. ph_exploratory walks through the exploratory and analysis of the FIES data. Models for each food expenditure are generated in ph_models.

FIES data is located in data directory. Graphs generated by running ph_models are stored in figs directory.
